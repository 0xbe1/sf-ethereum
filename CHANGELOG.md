for instructions to keep up to date.

## v0.10.0-rc.2

#### Added

* substreams-alpha client

#### Changed

* The default text `encoder` use to encode log entries now emits the level when coloring is disabled.
* Default value for flag `--mindreader-node-enforce-peers` is now `""`, this has been changed because the default value was useful only in development when running a local `node-manager` as either the miner or a peering node.

## v0.10.0-rc.1

#### Added

* Added block data file caching (called `ATM`), this is to reduce the memory usage of component keeping block objects in memory.
* Added transforms: LogFilter, MultiLogFilter, CallToFilter, MultiCallToFilter to only return transaction traces that match logs or called addresses.
* Added support for irreversibility indexes in firehose to prevent replaying reorgs when streaming old blocks.
* Added support for log and call indexes to skip old blocks that do not match any transform filter.

#### Changed

* Updated all Firehose stack direct dependencies.
* Updated confusing flag behavior for `--common-system-shutdown-signal-delay` and its interaction with `gRPC` connection draining in `firehose` component sometimes preventing it from shutting down.
* Reporting an error is if flag `merge-threshold-block-age` is way too low (< 30s).

#### Removed

* Removed some old components that are not required by Firehose stack directly, the repository is as lean as it ca now.

#### Fixed

* Fixed Firehose gRPC listening address over plain text.
* Fixed automatic merging of files within the `mindreader` is much more robust then before.
